## Welcome to Jim's Webpage on GitHub

Would you like to create your own website? If so, follow the breadcrumbs...
1. Create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/) ~5 min
2. 
3.

I use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hijimyu/hijimyu.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain the content for my website.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hijimyu/hijimyu.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
